Task 7: The "Prod" Guard (Booleans & Conditionals)

Scenario: A script is about to delete data.

Goal: Create a variable `env = "production"`. Write an `if` statement that only prints "Executing Delete" if `env` is NOT equal to "production". Otherwise, print "Access Denied: Cannot delete in Prod!"

DevOps Value: Implementing safety "gates" in CI/CD pipelines.

Instructions:
1. Create a variable env = "production"
2. Write an if statement to check the environment
3. Print "Executing Delete" only if NOT in production
4. Otherwise print "Access Denied: Cannot delete in Prod!"
