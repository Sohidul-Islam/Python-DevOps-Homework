Task 4: The Fleet Inventory (Lists)

Scenario: You have a list: `servers = ["web01", "db01", "app01", "web02"]`.

Goal: Use **slicing** to create a new list called `web_servers` containing only the first and last elements of the original list.

DevOps Value: Managing subsets of infrastructure (e.g., "only update the first 50% of nodes").

Instructions:
1. Start with the servers list: ["web01", "db01", "app01", "web02"]
2. Use slicing to extract first and last elements
3. Create a new list called web_servers
4. Print the result
