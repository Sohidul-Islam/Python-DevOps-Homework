Task 2: The "Safe Name" Sanitizer (Strings)

Scenario: A user wants to create a cloud bucket named `My Project Backup`. Cloud providers don't allow spaces or uppercase.

Goal: Use string methods to:
1. Strip whitespace
2. Replace spaces with hyphens
3. Convert to lowercase

DevOps Value: Standardizing resource names in Terraform/Cloud scripts.

Instructions:
1. Start with the bucket name: "My Project Backup"
2. Apply string transformations to make it cloud-provider friendly
3. Print the sanitized name
