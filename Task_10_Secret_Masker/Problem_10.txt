Task 10: The Secret Masker (Slicing)

Scenario: You accidentally printed an API Key to the console: `AKIA1234567890EXAMPLE`.

Goal: Use slicing to print only the first 4 characters followed by asterisks (e.g., `AKIA**********`).

DevOps Value: Security and compliance in logging.

Instructions:
1. Start with API key: "AKIA1234567890EXAMPLE"
2. Use slicing to get the first 4 characters
3. Calculate how many asterisks are needed
4. Combine and print the masked version
